{%note title=Technology Preview%}This feature is still under development and is subject to breaking changes until 10.1 is released {%endnote%}

In addition to the metrics shipped with the product, users are free to define additional metrics for application-specific data using the `@ServiceMetric` annotation. For example, suppose we have a `FooService` class which processes some application-specific requests, and we want to measure the number of processed requests:

{% highlight java %}
public class FooService {

    private final AtomicInteger processedRequests = new AtomicInteger();

    public void processRequest(Object request) {
        // TODO: Process request
        processedRequests.incrementAndGet();
    }

    @ServiceMetric(name="requests.processed")
    public int getPendingRequests() {
        return processedRequests.get();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

To activate the metric the service needs to be acknowledged as a bean, for example, using the `pu.xml`:

{% highlight java %}
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans">
                                          
	<bean id="FooService" class="com.gigaspaces.demo.FooService" />

</beans>
{% endhighlight %}

The metric name provided in the annotation is automatically prefixed to include information about the processing unit instance which hosts this service (for example: `xap.{host}.{pid}.gsc.pu.{pu-name}.{pu-instance}.requests.processed`).
