A processing unit is deployed onto the XAP runtime environment, which is called the [Service Grid](/product_overview/the-runtime-environment.html). It is responsible for materializing the processing unit’s configuration, provisioning its instances to the runtime infrastructure and making sure they continue to run properly over time.

# Starting a Service Grid

To start a Service Grid on a machine, launch the `gs-agent` utility located in the `<GSHOME>/bin` folder. This will start the [Grid Service Agent](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gsa), which is responsible of starting and managing the other Service Grid components (GSC, GSM, etc.). Command-line arguments are used to specify which Service Grid components should be started and managed. In general, `gsa.[process type] n` will start `n` instances of the specified `process type`. Use the `global` keyword (e.g. `gsa.global.[process type] n`) to specify that the agent should coordinate with other running agents the hosting and management of that service. For example, to start two GSCs, two global GSMs and two global LUSs, use the following command:

{% highlight xml %}
gs-agent gsa.gsc 2 gsa.global.gsm 2 gsa.global.lus 2
{% endhighlight %}

In fact, since this configuration is widely used, it is also default configuration - running `gs-agent` without any arguments would produce the same effect. If you simply want more GSCs (say, 3 instead of 2) and keep the other defaults, simply run:

{% highlight xml %}
gs-agent gsa.gsc 3
{% endhighlight %}

### Lookup Service Considerations

When starting a [Lookup Service](/product_overview/service-grid.html#lus) and other services in unicast mode (not multicast), it means that specific machines will be the ones that will run the [Lookup Service](/product_overview/service-grid.html#lus). This means that on the machines running the LUS, the following command will be used (assuming other defaults are used for GSM and GSC):

{% highlight xml %}
gs-agent gsa.global.lus 0 gsa.lus 1
{% endhighlight %}

And on machines that will not run the LUS, the following command should be used:

{% highlight xml %}
gs-agent gsa.global.lus 0
{% endhighlight %}

You can use the [GigaSpaces Universal Deployer](/sbp/universal-deployer.html) to deploy complex multi processing unit applications.

# Configuration

Service Grid configuration is often composed of two layers: system-wide configuration and component-specific configuration.

The system-wide configuration specifies settings which all components share, e.g. discovery (unicast/multicast), security, zones, etc. These are set using the `EXT_JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable.

The component-specific configuration specifies settings per component type, e.g. the GSC memory limit is greater than the GSM and LUS. These are set using one or more of the environment variables: `GSA_JAVA_OPTIONS`, `GSC_JAVA_OPTIONS`, `GSM_JAVA_OPTIONS`, `LUS_JAVA_OPTIONS`.

{%info%}The component-specific configuration override the system-wide configuration. {%endinfo%}

For example:

{% section %}
{% column width=50% %}
{% highlight xml %}
Linux
export GSA_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx256m
export GSC_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx2048m
export GSM_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx1024m
export LUS_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx1024m

./gs-agent.sh
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight xml %}
Windows
set GSA_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx256m
set GSC_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx2048m
set GSM_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx1024m
set LUS_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx1024m

call gs-agent.bat

# Customizing GSA Components

GSA manages different process types. Each process type is defined within the `<GSHOME>\config\gsa` directory in an xml file that identifies the process type by its name.

{% tip %}You can change the default location of the GSA configuration files using the `com.gigaspaces.grid.gsa.config-directory` system property.
{% endtip %}

The following are the process types that come out of the box:

{: .table .table-bordered .table-condensed}
|Processes Type|Description|XML config file name|Properties file name|
|:-------------|:----------|:-------------------|:-------------------|
|gsc|Defines a [Grid Service Container](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gsc)|gsc.xml|gsc.properties|
|gsm|Defines a [Grid Service Manager](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gsm)|gsm.xml|gsm.properties|
|lus|Defines a [Lookup Service](/product_overview/service-grid.html#lus)| lus.xml|lus.properties|
|gsm_lus|Defines a [Grid Service Manager](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gs) and [Lookup Service](/product_overview/service-grid.html#lus) within the same JVM|gsm_lus.xml|gsm_lus.properties|
|esm|Defines an Elastic Service Manager which is required for deploying [Elastic Processing Unit]({%currentjavaurl%}/elastic-processing-unit.html)|esm.xml|esm.properties |

Here is an example of the `gsc.xml` configuration file:

{% highlight xml %}
<process initial-instances="script" shutdown-class="com.gigaspaces.grid.gsa.GigaSpacesShutdownProcessHandler" restart-on-exit="always">
    <script enable="true" work-dir="${com.gs.home}/bin"
            windows="${com.gs.home}/bin/gs.bat" unix="${com.gs.home}/bin/gs.sh">
        <argument>start</argument>
        <argument>"GSC"</argument>
    </script>
    <vm enable="true" work-dir="${com.gs.home}/bin" main-class="com.gigaspaces.start.SystemBoot">
        <input-argument></input-argument>
        <argument>com.gigaspaces.start.services="GSC"</argument>
    </vm>
    <restart-regex>.*java\.lang\.OutOfMemoryError.*</restart-regex>
</process>
{% endhighlight %}

The GSA can either spawn a script based process, or a pure JVM (with its arguments) process. The GSC for example, allows for both types of process spawning.

* The `initial-instances` parameter controls what type of spawning will be performed when the GSA spawns processes by itself (and not on demand by the Admin API).
* The `shutdown-class` followed by the `restart-on-exit` flag, controls if the process will be restarted upon termination. There are three types of values:
   * `always` - Always restarts the process if it exits.
   * `never` - Never restarts the process if it exists.
   * `!0` - Restarts the process only if the exit code is different than 0.
* The `shutdown-class` is an implementation of `com.gigaspaces.grid.gsa.ShutdownProcessHandler` interface and provides the default shutdown hooks before and after shutdown of a process, to make sure it is shutdown properly. The `shutdown-class` can be omitted.
* The `restart-regex` (there can be more than one element) is applied to each console output line of the managed process, and if there is a match, the GSA will automatically restart the process. By default, the GSC will be restarted if there is an `OutOfMemoryError`.

In addition, within the `script` tag, you can add the following tags:

* `argument` - adds a command ling argument which will be passed to the script. In the `gsc.xml` example above, there are two command line arguments.
* `environment` -adds an environment variable. For example, `<environment name="GSC_JAVA_OPTIONS">-Xmx1024m</environment>` can be used to override the memory for the GSC.

# Advanced Configuration

In some scenarios you'll need to have several 'flavours' of components (e.g. multiple zones, or different sizes of GSCs, etc.). You can create a custom gs-agent script to manage each of those, or you can do this all within a single agent.

For example, suppose we want our agent to load 2 'small' GSCs (512MB each) in a zone called *Small*, and 1 'large' GSC (1024MB) in a zone called *Large*. To achieve this, we'll duplicate the default `gsc.xml` (which resides in `<GSHOME>/config/gsa`) into `gsc_small.xml` and `gsc_large.xml`, and modify them to include an `environment` tag which sets `GSC_JAVA_OPTIONS` to the required settings:

{% inittab %}
{% tabcontent gsc_small.xml %}
{% highlight xml %}
<process initial-instances="script" shutdown-class="com.gigaspaces.grid.gsa.GigaSpacesShutdownProcessHandler" restart-on-exit="always">
    <script enable="true" work-dir="${com.gs.home}/bin"
            windows="${com.gs.home}/bin/gs.bat" unix="${com.gs.home}/bin/gs.sh">
        <argument>start</argument>
        <argument>"GSC"</argument>
		<environment name="GSC_JAVA_OPTIONS">-Xmx512m -Dcom.gs.zones=Small</environment>
    </script>
    <vm enable="true" work-dir="${com.gs.home}/bin" main-class="com.gigaspaces.start.SystemBoot">
        <input-argument></input-argument>
        <argument>com.gigaspaces.start.services="GSC"</argument>
    </vm>
    <restart-regex>.*java\.lang\.OutOfMemoryError.*</restart-regex>
</process>
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabcontent %}
{% tabcontent gsc_large.xml %}
{% highlight xml %}
<process initial-instances="script" shutdown-class="com.gigaspaces.grid.gsa.GigaSpacesShutdownProcessHandler" restart-on-exit="always">
    <script enable="true" work-dir="${com.gs.home}/bin"
            windows="${com.gs.home}/bin/gs.bat" unix="${com.gs.home}/bin/gs.sh">
        <argument>start</argument>
        <argument>"GSC"</argument>
		<environment name="GSC_JAVA_OPTIONS">-Xmx1024m -Dcom.gs.zones=Large</environment>
    </script>
    <vm enable="true" work-dir="${com.gs.home}/bin" main-class="com.gigaspaces.start.SystemBoot">
        <input-argument></input-argument>
        <argument>com.gigaspaces.start.services="GSC"</argument>
    </vm>
    <restart-regex>.*java\.lang\.OutOfMemoryError.*</restart-regex>
</process>
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabcontent %}
{% endinittab %}

Now, to start the agent, we'll use the following command:

{% highlight xml %}
gs-agent gsa.gsc 0 gsa.gsc_small 2 gsa.gsc_large 1
{% endhighlight %}

{%info%}
Note that we're setting `gsa.gsc 0` to avoid loading the default `gsc` component.

# Overview

{%section%}
{%column width=50% %}
The basic unit of deployment in the GigaSpaces XAP platform is the [Processing Unit](./the-processing-unit-overview.html).

Once packaged, a processing unit is deployed onto the GigaSpaces runtime environment, which is called the *Service Grid*. It is responsible for materializing the processing unit's configuration, provisioning its instances to the runtime infrastructure and making sure they continue to run properly over time.

{% info %}When developing your processing unit, you can [run and debug the processing unit within your IDE](./running-and-debugging-within-your-ide.html). You will typically deploy it to the GigaSpaces runtime environment when it's ready for production or when you want to run it in the real-life runtime environment{% endinfo %}

# Service Grid Architecture

The service grid is composed of a number of components:

![gs_runtime.jpg](/attachment_files/gs_runtime.jpg)



## Core Components

A processing unit can be deployed to the Service Grid using one of GigaSpaces deployment tools (UI, CLI, API), which uploads it to the *GSM* [Grid Service Manager](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gsm), the component which manages the deployment and life cycle of the processing unit). The GSM analyzes the deployment descriptor and determines how many instances of the processing unit should be created, and which containers should run them. It then ships the processing unit code to the running *GSC*'s [Grid Service Container](./service-grid.html#gsc) and instructs them to instantiate the processing unit instances. The GSC provides an isolated runtime for the processing unit instance, and exposes its state to the GSM for monitoring. This phase in the deployment process is called *provisioning*.

Once provisioned, the GSM continuously monitors the processing unit instances to determine if they're functioning properly or not. When a certain instance fails, the GSM identifies that and re-provisions the failed instance on to another GSC, thus enforcing the processing unit's SLA.

In order to discover one another in the network, the GSCs and GSMs use a [Lookup Service](/product_overview/service-grid.html#lus), also called *LUS*. Each GSM and GSC registers itself in the LUS, and monitors the LUS to discover other GSM and GSC instances.

Finally, the *GSA* [Grid Service Agent](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gsa) component is used to start and manage the other components of the Service Grid (i.e. GSC, GSM, LUS). Typically, the GSA is started with the hosting machine's startup. Using the agent, you can bootstrap the entire cluster very easily, and start and stop additional GSCs, GSMs and lookup services at will.

All of the above components are fully manageable from the GigaSpaces management interfaces such as the [UI](./graphical-user-interface.html), CLI and [Admin API](./administration-and-monitoring-api.html).

## Optional Components

* The Elastic Service Manager (ESM) manages the [Elastic Processing Unit](./elastic-processing-unit.html) together with the GSM.

* The [Apache Load Balancer Agent](./apache-load-balancer-agent.html) is used when deploying web applications.

* The Transaction Manager (TXM) is an optional component. When executing transactions that spans multiple space partitions you should use the Jini Transaction Manager or the Distributed Transaction Manager. See the [Transaction Management](./transaction-management.html) section for details.
