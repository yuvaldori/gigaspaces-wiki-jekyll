# XAP - APM Introscope - Reference documentation

[CA APM](http://www.ca.com/us/products/application-performance-management.aspx) is a complex tool that helps to monitor applications and react quickly when certain performance issues may occur. XAP provides many metrics like: processing units, spaces and machines that compose the grid. The metrics can be reported to Instroscope, so that its advanced features might be used to further analyze metrics data.

XAP CA APM Introscope Reporter- it provides a way to send XAP related metrics to Introscope.


***


# Features

XAP-apm-introscope introduces the following features:

- reporting metrics to Introscope ([more details](#integration-details))
- inserting hierarchy into metrics ([more details](#metrics-hierarchy))
- modifying reported metrics names and values to conform Introscope requirements ([more details](#introscope-metrics-requirements)).


## Run requirements

- CA APM Introscope 9.6 environment. The integration was tested on the 9.6 version, however, higher versions (at least 9.x) should also integrate properly.
- Enabled network input in Introscope, Introscope reporter in XAP metrics configured ([more details](#configuration)).

# Quick steps

This paragraph shows how to quickly, using basing configuration set up a working environment with XAP sending metrics to CA Introscope.

## Basic configuration

The steps below use only basic configuration without getting into details, more information is available [here](#configuration).

1. Edit `IntroscopeEPAgent.properties` file: add line `introscope.epagent.config.networkDataPort=MY_PORT` (by default this line is commented), where `MY_PORT` should be replaced with a port number, on which EPAgent will wait for data.
2. Make sure that port `MY_PORT` is open on a machine where EPAgent will be deployed.
3. Edit `$GS_HOME/config/metrics/metrics.xml` file: add the following piece of XML code to `reporters` node (`MY_PORT` should be replaced with a value from the previous point, `MY_HOST` with IP address or hostname of a machine where EPAgent will be deployed):
{% highlight xml %}
    <reporter name="introscopeReporter" factory-class="com.gigaspaces.metrics.IntroscopeReporterFactory">
        <property name="host" value="MY_HOST"/>
        <property name="port" value="MY_PORT"/>
    </reporter>
{% endhighlight %}

## Starting Introscope and XAP

1. Start Introscope environment (steps to set up development environment are described [here](#development-environment-installation-steps)).
2. Start XAP grid by running command: `$GS_HOME/bin/gs-agent.sh`.

## Observing metrics

1. Log in to webview.
2. Go to `Investigator` tab, then `Metric Browser` tab.
3. Node `*SuperDomain*/XAP host/EPAgentProcess/EPAgent(*SuperDomain*)` should contain subnode `xap` that is a root of all metrics reported by XAP.

# Configuration

To properly work, XAP-apm-introscope requires a little configuration both on Introscope side and XAP side.

## Introscope properties

XAP-apm-introscope communicates with `EPAgent` deployed in an Introscope environment. It requires `EPAgent` to listen on a certain port for metrics data. To enable receiving metrics from network, property `introscope.epagent.config.networkDataPort` should be uncommented in `IntroscopeEPAgent.properties` (by default this is `EPAgent` configuration file, in case another file is used, described steps should be performed on that file) and set to port on which `EPAgent` will listen for metrics data, e.g.

{% highlight properties %}
     introscope.epagent.config.networkDataPort=8003
{% endhighlight %}

## XAP metrics configuration

File `$GS_HOME/config/metrics/metrics.xml` contains XAP metrics configuration. The part important for XAP-apm-introscope is a list of reporters - `IntroscopeReporter` must be added to it. Moreover, it has two obligatory properties:
- host - hostname or ip address of a machine with EPAgent,
- port - port on which EPAgent listens for metrics data. This value has to match `introscope.epagent.config.networkDataPort` property described in the previous subparagraph,and one optional property:
- hierarchy_pattern - pattern used to build name of the highest level of hierarchy. It may contain a `{lookuplocator}` or `{lookupgroup}` substrings, which will be replaced by current lookuplocator or lookupgroup, respectively. If output of pattern conversion is empty or contains `{` or `}` signs, then it will be recognized as invalid and an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown. This property is optional, since it has default value `{lookupgroup}-{lookuplocator}`.

Below is an exemplary piece of XML that should be put inside `metrics.xml` file.

{% highlight xml %}
     <reporters>
        <reporter name="introscopeReporter" factory-class="com.gigaspaces.metrics.IntroscopeReporterFactory">
            <property name="host" value="127.0.0.1"/>
            <property name="port" value="8000"/>
            <property name="hierarchy_pattern" value="grid-{lookupgroup}"/>
        </reporter>
    ...
    </reporters>
{% endhighlight %}

## Licensing
XAP-apm-introscope requires a separate license in addition to the XAP commercial license, please contact GigaSpaces Customer Support for more details.

# Integration details

This paragraph describes deeply the most important aspects of XAP-Introscope integration.

## Integration with XAP
XAP provides a well defined point of integration - [custom reporter](http://docs.gigaspaces.com/xap102adm/metrics-custom-reporter.html). The integration is implemented according to guidelines from Gigaspaces documentation:
- `IntroscopeRepoter` - the main class that handles sending metrics inherits from `MetricReporter`,
- `IntroscopeRepoterFactory` - a class that creates reporters derives from `MetricReporterFactory`.

## Integration with CA APM Introscope

Introscope gathers metrics data from applications using agents. It provides several agents - one agent per one web framework. However, this functionality is not needed to integrate with XAP, since all metrics are already being gathered by XAP. The problem lies in reporting data to Introscope. This task can be solved by `EPAgent`.

### EPAgent

`EPAgent` (Environment Performance Agent) is a special type of agent that is used to monitor system wide or user defined statistics. It is a natural point of integration with XAP. There are several ways of sending data to EPAgent: plugins, simple HTTP server, network communication.

1. Plugins - EPAgent allows users to define custom plugins that are either separate programs or Java classes run by `EPAgent`.

2. HTTP Server - `EPAgent` (in Introscope 9.6) can create a simple HTTP server. In that case metrics are reported by sending GET requests with metric data (metric name, type, value) in query to the server.

3. Network communication - `EPAgent` may expose a port on which it will listen for requests containing metric data.


Integration by plugins would require additional work, because plugin semantics is that it pulls data, while the desired behavior is to accept data sent by XAP. The second method conforms to this requirement, however, it is not scalable, since one request carries only one metric value. Obviously, it would cause too much overhead. Moreover, this feature is deprecated and may be removed from Introscope. The last proposal solves all those issues: `EPAgent` listens for data and one requests contains multiple entries.

#### Security warning
`EPAgent` accepts all data that it receives via network (i.e. without authentication). Therefore, access to it must be limited by firewall.

### Data format
`EPAgent` accepts metric data that is sent in specific format. Otherwise, it may log erroneus values or does not log them at all. Each line should contain data for one measured value. There are two formats for a single line: simple format or XML format. The latter one was chosen, since it provides more control over reported data (less restrictions on metric name, possibility to specify type of value).

Format of each line is as follows:
{% highlight xml %}
     <metric type="TYPE" name="NAME" value="VALUE" />
{% endhighlight %}

There are three fields that need to be filled: type, name and value. Only the first one requires a short comment. Introscope has a few types of metrics defined. Some of them are connected with a little bit of logic - e.g. Introscope may compute average value of all reported values. However, XAP-apm-introscope uses only the most basic ones - `LongCounter` for numerical data and `StringEvent` for others, because statistics are already processed by XAP and need only to be exported to Introscope.

Below is an example of metric data sent to Introscope:
{% highlight xml %}
    <metric type="LongCounter" name="xap|groupA|myhost|lus|20237:lus_items" value="1" />
<metric type="LongCounter" name="xap|groupA|myhost|lus|20237:lus_pending-events" value="0" />
<metric type="LongCounter" name="xap|groupA|space|space_metricsSpace|0|primary:operations_lease-expired" value="100" />
{% endhighlight %}

More details regarding each line will be explained in the next paragraph.

##### Timestamps warning
There is no possibility to tie metric data with timestamp. Introscope connects a single metric report with the time it was received by Introscope, not sent by XAP. This means that sending metrics in batch should be disabled, when integrating both systems.

## Hierarchy insertion

XAP reports tens of different predefined metrics per each machine that belongs to grid, deployed processing unit or space (you can find more information [here](http://docs.gigaspaces.com/xap102adm/metrics-bundled.html)). Additionally, there might be also custom metrics defined by users. Even for one machine, number of metrics becomes too high for human-being to track them easily in webview in flat format. Hierarchy is inserted by modifying metric name - it has the given format:

{% highlight yaml %}
     RESOURCE_SEGMENT_1|...|RESOURCE_SEGMENT_N:METRIC_NAME
{% endhighlight %}

Resource segments are optional. They are separated from name by `:` and are separated from each other by `|`. Multiple resource segments create hierarchy, e.g. metrics `xap|groupA|myhost|lus|21950:lus_items` and `xap|groupA|myhost|lus|21950:lus_listeners` can be seen as:

{% highlight xml %}
xap
+-- groupA
  +-- myhost
    +-- lus
      +-- 21950
        --- lus_items
        --- lus_listeners
{% endhighlight %}
in treelike format. `IntroscopeReporter` takes care of inserting hierarchy into predefined metrics, while custom metrics are reported without any name modifications.


# Metrics conversions

Important task of `IntroscopeReporter` is to convert received metrics to Introscope format. The format was described in the previous paragraph, this paragraph lists all conversions done on metrics.

## Metrics hierarchy

Inserting hierarchy into metric name depends on an initial metric name and available additional data retrieved from `MetricTagsSnapshot`. XAP comes with predefined metrics and hierarchy related conversions are performed for such metrics, while custom metrics names are almost untouched.

#### Operating system metrics
OS metrics name starts with `os_`. `IntroscopeReporter` performs different conversion on network related and non-network related statistics.

#### OS metrics / network metrics
Metric name startswith `os_network_`.

Format: `xap|$TOP_LEVEL|$HOST|os|network|$NIC:METRIC_NAME_WITHOUT_PREFIX`

|Before conversion|After conversion|
|:-----|---------|
| os_network_rx-bytes | `xap|groupA|myhost|os|network|eth0:rx-bytes` |

#### OS metrics / non-network metrics
Metric name starstwith `os_` and not with `os_network_`.

Format: `xap|$TOP_LEVEL|$HOST|os|others:METRIC_NAME`

|Before conversion|After conversion|
|:-----|---------|
| os_memory_free-bytes | `xap|groupA|myhost|os|others:os_memory_free-bytes` |

### Process|JVM|LRMI metrics
Those metrics start with "process_", "jvm_" or "lrmi_". There are 2 subtypes - metrics for specific pu or process-wide (e.g. for GSA, GSC, etc.).

#### Process|JVM|LRMI metrics / per PU
Metric tags contain `pu_name` key.

Format: `xap|$TOP_LEVEL|pu|$PU_NAME|$PU_INSTANCE_ID|nonspace:METRIC_NAME`

|Before conversion|After conversion|
|:-----|---------|
| jvm_threads_count | `xap|groupA|pu|my_pu|2_2|nonspace:jvm_threads_count` |

#### Process|JVM|LRMI metrics / process-wide
Metric tags do not contain `pu_name` key.

Format: `xap|$TOP_LEVEL|$HOST|$PROCESS_NAME_$PID:METRIC_NAME`

|Before conversion|After conversion|
|:-----|---------|
| jvm_threads_count | `xap|groupA|myhost|gsm_4165:jvm_threads_count` |

### Lookup service metrics
Metric name has a `lus_` prefix.

Format: `xap|$TOP_LEVEL|$HOST|lus|$PID:METRIC_NAME`

|Before conversion|After conversion|
|:-----|---------|
| lus_items | `xap|groupA|myhost|lus|4623:lus_items` |

### Processing unit metrics
Metric name has a `pu_` prefix.

Format: `xap|$TOP_LEVEL|pu|$PU_NAME|$PU_INSTANCE_ID|nonspace:`<br>`METRIC_NAME_WITHOUT_PREFIX`

|Before conversion|After conversion|
|:-----|---------|
| pu_data<br>ProcessorPollingEventContainer<br>_processed-events | `xap|groupA|pu|just_space-processor|2_1|nonspace:`<br>`dataProcessorPollingEventContainer`<br>`_processed-events` |

### Space metrics
Space metrics name starts with "space_". Metrics for primary and backup are converted a little bit different.

#### Space metrics / primary partition
Metric tag `space_active` has value `true`.

Format: `xap|$TOP_LEVEL|space|space_$SPACE_NAME|$SPACE_INSTANCE_ID|primary:`<br>`METRIC_NAME_WITHOUT_PREFIX`

|Before conversion|After conversion|
|:-----|---------|
| space_operations_take | `xap|groupA|space|space_my_pu_space|1|primary:`<br>`operations_take` |

#### Space metrics / backup partition
Metric tag `space_active` has value `false`.

Format: `xap|$TOP_LEVEL|space|space_$SPACE_NAME|$SPACE_INSTANCE_ID|backup:`<br>`METRIC_NAME_WITHOUT_PREFIX`

|Before conversion|After conversion|
|:-----|---------|
| space_operations_take | `xap|groupA|space|space_my_pu_space|1|backup:`<br>`operations_take` |

### Other metrics
Metrics that do not meet conditions of any types presented above, are considered as others and almost no conversion is performed on them.

Format: `xap|$TOPLEVEL:METRIC_NAME`

|Before conversion|After conversion|
|:-----|---------|
| custom_metric | `xap|groupA:custom_metric` |


## Data types
As was mentioned earlier, XAP-apm-introscope uses two types of metrics: `LongCounter` and `StringEvent`. `LongCounter` is reserved for numerical values - if an object representing metric value inherits from `Numerical`, it is supposed to be logged as `LongCounter`. Otherwise, metric type would be `StringEvent`.

Please note that a String object with numerical value (e.g. "0") would be recognized as `StringEvent`.

## Introscope metrics requirements
Introscope adds a few constraints on metrics and `IntroscopeReporter` conforms to all of them by modifying metric names or values.

Metric name and resource segments are cleaned from special signs, i.e. `:` and `|`. If a full name contains more than one resource-name separator (`:`), then this metric will not be logged at all. If any of resource segments contains resouce-resource separator (`|`), then a hierarchy level will be split.

Metric value of `LongCounter` type must carry integer value. Unfortunately, Introscope does not have any separate type for floats/doubles. Therefore, all numeric values are rounded. There are a few predefined metrics that suffer a little from this constraint (e.g. `process_cpu_used-percent`). However, those values are from 0 to 100 and in most cases reporting 65 instead of 64.7 is acceptable. It is worth to remember about this requirement if custom metrics with narrow range of values (e.g. from 0.0 to 1.0) may be defined - in this case it could make sense to report values multiplied by 10, 100, etc.


# Development environment installation steps

Steps below describe how to set up development environment to start working on this plugin. Requirements:
- EPAgent9.6.0.0unix.tar,
- introscope9.6.0.0otherUnix.jar,
- osgiPackages.v9.6.0.0.unix.tar

files on your disk (they cannot be uploaded to repo because of license restrictions).

1. Install `docker` and `docker-compose`.
2. Clone repo `https://github.com/stefansiegl/docker-introscope.git`.
3. Copy `introscope9.6.0.0otherUnix.jar` and `osgiPackages.v9.6.0.0.unix.tar` to docker-introscope/enterprise-manager/9.6.0.0, docker-introscope/sample/9.6.0.0 and docker-introscope/webview/9.6.0.0.
4. Copy `EPAgent9.6.0.0unix.tar` to docker-introscope/sample/9.6.0.0.
5. Edit file docker-introscope/sample/9.6.0.0/IntroscopeEPAgent.properties, in section EPAgent Configuration uncomment line containing `introscope.epagent.config.networkDataPort` and change port if the default one is taken.
6. Edit file docker-introscope/sample/9.6.0.0/run-default-sample-container.sh and open port used in the previous point by adding `-p PORT:PORT` to the `docker run` command, where `PORT` should be substituted with a proper port number.
7. Run command: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-with-sample.yml up`
8. Open your browser on a page `webview-ip`:8080 (`webview-ip` is an IP adress of docker container), type: user: `Admin` and password leave empty. In case you receive HTTP 404 error, wait a minute, because server used in webview needs a little time to start working.
